Repository associated with the paper "Modeling and predicting the overlap of B- and T-cell receptor repertoires in healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.17.473105v1). 
Each figure, except Figure 4, is generated using the Jupyter notebook file Figure(n)_all.ipynb. The fign_all.pdf is the resulting figure after modification on Inkscape. Sketch shown in Figure 1 was designed using MacBook's default Keynote.
